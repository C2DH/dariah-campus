abstract:
  'This lesson looks at how interviews with survivors of concentration camps
  collected by the Latvian-Jewish psychologist David Boder with a wire recorder
  in 1946 were eventually turned into digital data that is accessible on a
  website today. Consisting of a clip, a quiz, an interactive digital
  documentary, and a series of assignments, the lesson examines the
  transformation of information from one medium (and technology) to another.
  Understanding these changes Is key for a critical appraisal of digital
  history.'

As historians, we are confronted with an abundance of data in digital form that
can be searched, annotated, analysed, presented and reused with the help of a
broad array of digital tools.

But what do we know about how digital technology affects the artefactual and
informational value of a source?

When looking through the lens of source criticism to digitized and digital born
sources, there are so many mediating processes going on before a source can
appear on our screen, that historians run the risk of getting detached from the
original context of the source.

The premise of the lesson _David Boder: From Wire Recordings to Website_
available on the [Ranke.2 platform](https://ranke2.uni.lu/u/boder/) is that the
recordings that David Boder made in 1946 in order to preserve the history of the
Holocaust via interviews conducted with a wire recorder have been made newly
available in digital form on the web when the interviews were transformed and
made available in 2009.

The lesson starts off with a short animation lasting 6.50 minutes, narrated by
researcher
[Stefania Scagliola](https://www.c2dh.uni.lu/people/stefania-scagliola), in
which she expands on Boder's original interviews and discuss the importance of
applying source criticism to the transformation of the interviews from their
original form to a digital one.

The clip is then repeated a second time in the form of a quiz to enable you to
test your understanding of the content, and a third time as an interactive
documentary. This is followed by a series of assignments that connect to the
topics in the animation in an accessible and engaging way:

- Being introduced to the
